Kinect2-Data-Transmitter
========================

Kinect v2 data to Unity

This is a stop gap solution based on the good work for Kinect 1 by https://github.com/Phybbit at https://github.com/Phybbit/kinect-data-transmitter, which has now also been updated to work with the Kinect v2.

**** This is based on preliminary software and/or hardware, subject to change. ****

"Kinect2 Data Transmitter is an update of KinectDataTransmitter, a .net4 project that reads the data from the kinect device and sends it over IPC to your Unity3D process. It helps to bind both the Microsoft Kinect SDK and Unity without going through wrapping native code."

Here's a Unity project showing how it works: http://bit.ly/1hWzRhn
