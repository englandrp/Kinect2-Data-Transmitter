Kinect2-Data-Transmitter
========================

Kinect v2 data to Unity

**** This is based on preliminary software and/or hardware, subject to change. ****

Kinect2 Data Transmitter is an update of KinectDataTransmitter, a .net4 project that reads the data from the kinect device and sends it over IPC to your Unity3D process. It helps to bind both the Microsoft Kinect SDK and Unity without going through wrapping native code.

Currently supported features:

Kinect hardware setup (single device)
Skeletal tracking (single user)
Access to parts of the interaction library
